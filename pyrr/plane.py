"""Provide functions for the creation and manipulation of Planes.

Planes are represented using a numpy.array of shape (4,).
The values represent the plane equation using the values A,B,C,D.

The first three values are the normal vector.
The fourth value is the distance of the origin from the plane, down the normal.
A negative value indicates the origin is behind the plane, relative to the normal.
