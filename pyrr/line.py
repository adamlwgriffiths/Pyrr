"""Provide functions for the creation and manipulation of Lines.

A Line data structure is simply a numpy.array with 2 vectors::

    start = numpy.array( [ -1.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] )
    end = numpy.array( [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] )
    line = numpy.array( [ start, end ] )

Both Lines and Line Segments are defined using the same data structure.
The only difference is how the data is interpreted.

A line is defined by two points but extends infinitely.

A line segment only exists between two points.
It does not extend forever.

The choice to interpret a line as a line or line segment is up to the
function being called. Check the function signature of documentation
to determine how a line will be interpreted.
