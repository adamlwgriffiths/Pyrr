Examples
--------

Maintain a rotation (quaternion) and translation (vector) and convert to a matrix

Object Oriented Interface

    from pyrr import Quaternion, Matrix44, Vector3
    import numpy as np

    point = Vector3([1.,2.,3.])
    orientation = Quaternion()
    translation = Vector3()
    scale = Vector3([1.,1.,1.])

    # translate along X by 1
    translation += [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    # rotate about Y by pi/2
    rotation = Quaternion.from_y_rotation(np.pi / 2.0)
    orientation = rotation * orientation

    # create a matrix
    # start our matrix off using the scale
    matrix = Matrix44.from_scale(scale)

    # apply our orientation
    # we can multiply matricies and quaternions directly!
    matrix = matrix * orientation

    # apply our translation
    translation = Matrix44.from_translation(translation)
    matrix = matrix * translation

    # transform our point by the matrix
    # vectors are transformable by matrices and quaternions directly
    point = matrix * point


Procedural Interface

    from pyrr import quaternion, matrix44, vector3
    import numpy as np

    point = vector3.create(1.,2.,3.)
    orientation = quaternion.create()
    translation = vector3.create()
    scale = vector3.create(1,1,1)

    # translate along X by 1
    translation += [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    # rotate about Y by pi/2
    rotation = quaternion.create_from_y_rotation(np.pi / 2.0)
    orientation = quaternion.cross(rotation, orientation)

    # create a matrix
    # start our matrix off using the scale
    matrix = matrix44.create_from_scale(scale)

    # apply our orientation
    orientation = matrix44.create_from_quaternion(orientation)
    matrix = matrix44.multiply(matrix, orientation)

    # apply our translation
    translation_matrix = matrix44.create_from_translation(translation)
    matrix = matrix44.multiply(matrix, translation_matrix)

    # transform our point by the matrix
    point = matrix44.apply_to_vector(matrix, point)



Object Oriented Features
========================

Convertable types
-----------------


    from pyrr import Quaternion, Matrix33, Matrix44, Vector3, Vector4

    v3 = Vector3([1.,0.,0.])
    v4 = Vector4.from_vector3(v3, w=1.0)
    v3, w = Vector3.from_vector4(v4)

    m44 = Matrix44()
    q = Quaternion(m44)
    m33 = Matrix33(q)

    m33 = Matrix44().matrix33
    m44 = Matrix33().matrix44
    q = Matrix44().quaternion
    q = Matrix33().quaternion

    m33 = Quaternion().matrix33
    m44 = Quaternion().matrix44


Convenient Operators
--------------------

    from pyrr import Quaternion, Matrix44, Matrix33, Vector3, Vector4
    import numpy as np

    # matrix multiplication
    m = Matrix44() * Matrix33()
    m = Matrix44() * Quaternion()
    m = Matrix33() * Quaternion()

    # matrix inverse
    m = ~Matrix44.from_x_rotation(np.pi)

    # quaternion multiplication
    q = Quaternion() * Quaternion()
    q = Quaternion() * Matrix44()
    q = Quaternion() * Matrix33()

    # quaternion inverse (conjugate)
    q = ~Quaternion()

    # quaternion dot product
    d = Quaternion() | Quaternion()

    # vector oprations
    v = Vector3() + Vector3()
    v = Vector4() - Vector4()

    # vector transform
    v = Quaternion() * Vector3()
    v = Matrix44() * Vector3()
    v = Matrix44() * Vector4()
    v = Matrix33() * Vector3()

    # dot and cross products
    dot = Vector3() | Vector3()
    cross = Vector3() ^ Vector3()
